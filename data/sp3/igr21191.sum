REMARKS concerning the IGR Orbit Combination:                                  
---------------------------------------------

 1. Broadcast ("brd") orbits/clocks are included in the combination for
    statistics only.  However broadcast clock corrections are used for clock 
    alignment to GPS time and centre clock weight determination purposes. Starting
    09-Oct-2012 (GPS Week 1709, day 2, MJD 56209), a new solution from Wuhan
    University (WHU) is included for comparison only. Starting 02-Mar-2014 (GPS
    Week 1782, day 0, 56718), 24h of 4-10 hour orbit and clock predictions from
    the IGS Real-time Service (IGC) are compared to the IGS Rapid products.

 2. The following centre solutions (orbits/clocks) were excluded from the
    combination but kept for statistics:
    
               -> Centre: IGA IGU 

 3. The following centre clock solutions, which provide broadcast clock
    corrections, were excluded from the combination but kept in the
    combination statistics:
    
               -> Centre: NGS 

 4. The following clock solutions were excluded from the combination because
    they were biasing the combined clock solutions (clock shifts/outliers)
    but were kept for the RMS computation.
    All clocks from USN.

               ----+--------+---------------

                1  |  GFZ   | 4 18 REUN
                1  |  USN   | COCO

 5. Starting 5-Nov-2006 (GPS Week 1400, day 0, MJD 54044) until 16-Apr-2011
    (GPS Week 1631, day 6, MJD 55667) all IGS products, including the IGS
    combined orbits, are based on the IGS realization of the ITRF2005 reference
    frame (IGS05).   For more information see IGSMAIL #5447.  The IGS05 frame
    is also the basis for the homogeneously reprocessed IGS products from GPS
    Weeks 730 to 1459 (1994-2007); see IGSMAIL #6136.
    
    Starting 17-Apr-2011 (GPS Week 1632, day 0, MJD 55668) all IGS products,
    are based on the IGS realization of the ITRF2008 reference frame (IGS08).
    For more information see IGSMAIL #6354.
    
    Starting 07-Oct-2012 (GPS Week 1709, day 0, MJD 56207) all IGS products,
    are based on the updated IGS08 frame (IGb08).
    For more information see IGSMAIL #6663.
    
    Starting 29-Jan-2017 (GPS Week 1934, day 0, MJD 57782) all IGS products,
    are based on the IGS realization of the ITRF2014 reference frame (IGS14).
    For more information see IGSMAIL #7399.
    
    Starting 17-May-2020 (GPS Week 2106, day 0, MJD 58986) all IGS products,
    are based on the updated IGS14 reference frame (IGb14).
    For more information see IGSMAIL #7921.

 6. Starting on 5-Nov-2000 (GPS Week 1087-0; mjd=51853) all IGS clock products
    are based on the new clock combination scheme which uses the the clock
    RINEX files as input if available, otherwise SP3 clocks are used.
    The navigation solution is still based on the SP3 clocks but this will
    soon adopt the clock RINEX files as well.

 7. Starting 5-Nov-2006 (GPS Week 1400, day 0, MJD 54044) until 16-Apr-2011
    (GPS Week 1631, day 6, MJD 55667) the absolute antenna model is introduced
    (IGSMAIL #5438). The antenna phase center offsets and phase center
    variations are given in the file:
        ftp://igs.org/igscb/station/general/igs05.atx
    These antenna calibrations are also used in the homogeneously reprocessed
    IGS products from GPS Weeks 730 to 1459 (1994-2007); see IGSMAIL #6136.
    
    Starting 17-Apr-2011 (GPS Week 1632, day 0, MJD 55668) the absolute antenna
    model is updated (IGSMAIL #6255 & #6374) as given in the file:
        ftp://igs.org/igscb/station/general/igs08.atx
    
    The JPL solution did not use IGS08/igs08.atx until GPS Week 1649, day 1,
    which caused their RMS clock residuals to be higher during that period
    than for the other centres.
    
    Starting 07-Oct-2012 (GPS Week 1709, day 0, MJD 56207) the igs08.atx absolute
    antenna model file gives updated (IGSMAIL #6662) values for the JPSREGANT_DD
    and JPSREGANT_SD antennas, plus updates for GPS IIF transmit antennas. This
    updated file should be used in conjunction with IGb08. Though, igs08.atx is
    also still consistent with IGS08.
    
    Starting 29-Jan-2017 (GPS Week 1934, day 0, MJD 57782) the absolute antenna
    model file has been updated to igs14.atx to be consistent with IGS14.

         average combination. 

         The last column gives the IGR resulting satellite accuracy measures 
         found in the IGS SP3 header. Eclipsing satellites are flagged with
         "E" (or "M" for moon) beside the PRN number. "X" stands for excluded
         from RMS, WRMS and MEDI-combination statistics but included in IGU
